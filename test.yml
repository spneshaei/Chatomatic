    - What is argumentation?
    - "<p>Argumentation describes a systematic process which supports a statement based on an idea, a concept or a fact.  &#128107;</p>
      <p>It can simply be described like this: ''An argument is a statement or set of statements that you use in order to try to convince people that your opinion about something is correct.''</p>
      <p>There are actually great videos out there from which you can learn a lot. Here are two of my favorites so far:</p>

    - Could you explain more about the structure of arguments?
    - "<p>Of course! I can go further into detail by explaining the structure of an argument to you.</p>
       <p>An argument consists of two basic elements. The premise and the claim. In order to claim something in your argument, you have to set up the associated premise to support your very claim. A basic argument for examble consists of two premisses which set up the theme for the final claim (conclusion)
          There is actually a very famous explanation of this from Aristotle. ''Because all men are mortal
          (premise 1) and Socrates is a man (premise 2), Socrates is mortal (claim).''.
          Looking at this it must be clear how a basic argument is formed.</p>
       <p> There are several ways to structure an argument. The basic argument is the easiest structure in order to create a complete argument. </p>

    - Could you tell me about the different types of arguemtative essay writing?
    - "<p>Of course! I will show you the two different types of argumentative essay writing.</p>
    <p>First of all, neither type is better than the other! It just depends in which context you are using them. With my sentiment analysis I can help you to achieve your desired writing goal.</p>
    <h4>Opinion Writing, Persuasive Writing, Argumentative Writing </h4>
    <p>There are actually three different styles in which you can write your essay. They do differ in their argumentation structure in order to reach their desired goal;convincing the reader.</p>
    <p>There is actually a great summery of the different styles and their individual purpose. Look at it carefully in order to write your essay intentionally towards one style.
    This will enable you to adapt your text to your individual circumstances. You should pay particular attention to your emotional attitude in the different forms of writing.
    With my assistance it is possible for you to keep an eye on your emotional attitude at all times!

    - How is sentiment measured?
    - "<p> There are a variety of ways in which sentiment is measured by different researchers in the field.</p>
    <p>A sentiment analysis (also called opinion mining) uses Natural Language Processing, text analysis and more linguistic tools to identify, analyse, structure and
     categorize a given text into its sentimental state. This includes the categorization of the polarity and of the subjectivity which both form
     the overall sentimental state of your text. &#128209;</p>

  -
    - What is polarity and how can I improve it?
    - "<p> The polarity is depending on your chosen writing style.
      The polarity of your text reflects your emotional preference. This can be positive or negative.
      A negative polarity score means that your essay text is written overall negatively, a positive polarity score describe the exact opposite.
      The targeted polarity score can depend on your writing style and the personal attitude towards the topic. You can intentionally adjust your overall polarity of your text by using
      intentionally placed adjectives.
      It makes a difference if you say ''I like the movie'' or if you say ''I love the movie''. Therefore adjusting your wording  will give your text a slightly different emotional state. You can also be very neutral about your
      arguments, which will give your essay a more balanced and serious tone. As you can tell, there is no right or wrong. You have to intentionally choose a style. &#128515;</p>
      <p>Do you know what writing style you want to choose? Bellow you will find a great explanation of the different writing styles and their use cases.</p>

  -
    - What is subjectivity/objectivity and how can I improve it?
    - "<p> The subjectivity is depending on your chosen writing style. Staying 100% Objective while writing an argumentation is very difficult. But depending on your targeting audience,
       you want to keep an eye on your subjectivity score. In an academic environment it is more favorable to write objective and factual based text instead of
       being subjective. The subjectivity of your text somehow also reflects your emotional preference. 
       The overall goal is to have a balanced point of view and therefore not to be too biased towards one side. This will allow your readers to understand various points of views instead of being convinced of your opinion.  &#128107;
       Nevertheless, depending on your use case it may be your goal to write a subjective text or to write an objective text. Bellow you will find a list of different writing styles and their use case. With that list, you can intentionally write your text towards a direction. </p>
       <p> This is contradictory to a persuasive writing style in which your main goal is to emphasize or change the beliefs of the reader. Therefore it should
        be your goal to be objective in your overall writing. </p>
